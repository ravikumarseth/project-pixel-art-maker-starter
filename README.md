# Pixel Art Maker Project

In this project a single-page web app is built that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

For creating the Pixel Art Grid, enter the number of rows, columns and select the color to be used before clicking submit. The Grid should appear after clicking submit. Play around with grid and create art! If you happen to make a mistake then click the box again to remove the color.
